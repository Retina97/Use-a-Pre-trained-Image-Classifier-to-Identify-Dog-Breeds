# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
Submission and extra information

For the uploaded images section, I added an image of a German shepherd. All models identify the breed correctly

AlexNet and ResNet was the fastest classifier (0 seconds), and VGG was the slowest at 3 seconds.
